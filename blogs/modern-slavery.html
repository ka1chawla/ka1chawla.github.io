            <p>In todays world <strong>middle class</strong> are the slaves of the rich. They are the ones who are working 12 hours a day for 365 days a year to pay for their children's education and their own retirement.</p>
            
            <!-- <h2>What is Modern Slavery?</h2> -->
            <p>Middle class slavery encompasses various forms of exploitation where individuals are working to make ends meet and making others rich like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Governments :</strong> Tax extracted with no accountability</li>
                <li><strong>School owners:</strong> Brokend education system to fill their pockets of School owners & suck the money of parents.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Landlords:</strong> pay monthly rents </li>
                <li><strong>Cooperate Real esatate agents:</strong> These are the real owners & money makers of the system, they own prime land & get rents for generations on them</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Justice system</strong> is the biggest lie in the system, it is a tool to control the masses & keep them in the dark. Average case in jusdicary takes 10 yeaars that is a decade & some case take 20 years that is a generation. And even after this long process you don't get justice in 99% of the cases especially in the cases of the poor & middle class.</p>
            <p>Expecting justice in India is like living in fools paradise.<strong>Justice system</strong> has no accountability to people they are not choosen by people nor are they choosen by the law. They are choosen by the rich & powerful who have the money to buy justice.</p>

                "Slavery is not a thing of the past. It exists today in many forms, often hidden in plain sight, affecting millions of people around the world."
            </div>
            
            <h2>Lets talk about major spending of middle class i.e Housing</h2>
            <p>Home Loan is attractive bussiness which runs the economy from banks to government everyone loves to give home loans to middle class.Home loan is sure shot weapon to make a person slave for 20-30 years. If lot are going well goverments are happy else 2008 like crisis is waiting for world.</p>
            <p>If you are buying a peace of land with no strings attached then may be after 20 years you hit a secured retirement but if you buy flat or leased property then your old age is also screwed for sure as in 20-30 years the flat or multistory building would need 5x the maintenance cost and in few years after your retirement may be whole multistory building would be demolished for new construction. as it's age is 30-40 years.</p>
            <p>In todays world i.e first half of 21st century most workers in below cities would have difficult old age because of the investment in flats & multistory buildings system</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Noida</li> 
                <li>Banglore</li> 
                <li>Gurgaon</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Lets talk of Noida first as it has the most corrupt builders and worst judicary oversight </p>
            <p>People have given full payment for their houses and business units in Noida and still after 15 years their house is not complete and if it is complete they are just lease holders not the actual owners pf the land as land is owned by builder for 99 years in many cases only sub lease is done to buyers.</p>
            
            <!-- <h2>Industries Most Affected</h2> -->
            <p>Here the builders mad fortune for next 99 years as they will get money for this land for next 99 years and act as landloard for next 99 years , they charge you for :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lease transfer</li>
                <li>Monthly Maintenance</li> 
                <li>Inflated electricity bills</li>
                <li>Parking charges</li>
                <li>Security charges</li>
                <li>Club membership charges</li>
                <li>Club membership charges</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In commercial building the situation is much worse builder is charging on every small work withs poor maintenance and no accountability.</p>

            <!-- <h2>Root Causes</h2>
            <p>The persistence of modern slavery can be attributed to several factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> Poverty and lack of opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Legal Frameworks:</strong> Insufficient laws and enforcement</li>
                <li><strong>Corruption:</strong> Bribery and lack of accountability</li>
                <li><strong>Demand for Cheap Labor:</strong> Consumer pressure for low-cost goods</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict and Displacement:</strong> War and natural disasters</li>
            </ul> -->
            
            <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
            <p>Addressing modern slavery requires collective action:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Raise awareness about the issue</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Choices:</strong> Buy land & build your own house</li>
                <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Support organizations fighting builder lobby</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Support:</strong> Advocate for buyer supporting laws</li>
                <!-- <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Report suspected cases to authorities</li> --> 
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Middle class can bypass this slavery by returning to their roots i.e agriculture & farming or if avoiding big cities like Noida, Banglore, Gurgaon, Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, etc. is not possible then they can buy land & build their own house in 100 km radius of these cities rather than living in bussiness centers of the city. They can also buy land & build a multistory building & rent it out to others. Thirdly uniting in groups to fight this builder lobby and fight for their rights by pressing goverments to make laws in their favour.</p>
